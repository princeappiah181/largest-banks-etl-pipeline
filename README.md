# Largest Banks ETL Pipeline

This project is the final capstone of the IBM Python Project for Data Engineering certification.

It automates the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for the world’s top 10 banks by market capitalization:

- Extracts data from Wikipedia
- Transforms market caps into GBP, EUR, and INR using exchange rates
- Loads the data into a CSV file and an SQLite database

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, SQLite3, Requests, NumPy

## Key Files
- banks_project.py – Main ETL script
- exchange_rate.csv – Exchange rates for transformation
- Largest_banks_data.csv – Final transformed data output
- Banks.db – SQLite database file (if small enough for upload)


## Certificate

Built as a part of IBM’s Data Engineering program – demonstrating real-world ETL skills using Python.
